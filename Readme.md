Chatbot Project – Online Food Delivery Assistant
A modern, conversational AI chatbot designed to streamline the online food ordering experience. Built with FastAPI for backend logic and Google Dialogflow for natural language understanding, this project demonstrates end-to-end chatbot development—from intent recognition to order processing and real-time order tracking.

Key Features
Conversational Ordering:
Supports placing new food orders and tracking existing orders through natural language interactions.

Dialogflow Integration:
Utilises Google Dialogflow for advanced intent detection and entity extraction.

FastAPI Backend:
Handles backend business logic, order management, and API integrations efficiently.

Context Management:
Manages user sessions and context to provide a seamless, multi-turn conversation flow.

Modular Architecture:
Clean separation between frontend chatbot, NLP (Dialogflow), and backend (FastAPI) components.
